This folder contains all four models described in the thesis.
They were written in VIM and Eclipse and compiled using CMake and Clang, but a
simple command line invocation of gcc should do too. You'll need some or all of
these arguments and maybe more (and don't forget to tell the compiler where the

-Wall -g -std=c++0x -DIL_STD -ffloat-store -m64 -DILOUSEMT -D_REENTRANT
-DILM_REENTRANT -lilocplex -lcp -lconcert -lcplex -lm -lpthread -lrt -lgsl
-lgslcblas
