Problem Description
-------------------

An hospital has to assign nurses to shifts. There are 12 nurses, 4 shifts
and 14 days to schedule.  For each day, a minimum number of nurses have
to be assigned to each shifts.  The problem is to have a fair spread
of the the number of nurses allocated to all the shifts. We don't know
precisely in advance how many nurses must be assigned to each, we only
have a minimum.  For instance, if for one day a minimum of 3 nurses are
required for the first shift, 2 for the second, 4 for the third and 0 for
the fourth, then 12-(3+2+4)=3 nurses can be assigned this day to any of
the shift. The goal is to have a fair spread of these 3 assignments among
the shifts. For instance, we could have one nurse more in the first shift,
one more in the second and one more in the third. On the other hand
if 3 more nurses are added to the first shift then the solution is not
well balanced.
