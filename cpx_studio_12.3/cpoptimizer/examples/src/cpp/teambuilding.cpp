Problem Description:
-------------------
The HR department of a company organizes an integration day to welcome new employees.
The problem is to configure 10 teams of 6 people that respect the following rules:
There are 30 new employees and 30 existing employees. They work in 6 different services lettered A to F.
A team must have 3 existing employees and 3 new employees, and at most 4 people from the same service.
Some new employees are coached by an existing employee, and an existing employee can coach only one new employee.
A new employee who is coached must be in the team of his coach.
Furthermore, employees of services A and B cannot be in the same team; employees of services E and F cannot be in the same team.

Each person is represented by a number in 0-59; new employees are the even numbers, existing employees are the odd numbers.

Service       Range
  A          0-19
  B          20-39
  C          40-44
  D          45-49
  E          50-54
  F          55-59

In Service A: the couples coach/coached new employee are 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11
In Service B: the couples coach/coached new employee are 20-21, 22-23, 24-25, 26-27, 28-29, 30-31
In Services C,D,E,F, the couples coach/coached new employee are 40-41, 42-43, 45-46, 47-48, 50-51, 52-53, 55-56, 57-58


Additional constraints:

Person number 5 must be with either person 41 or person 51.
Person number 15 must be with either 40 or person 51.
Person number 25 must be with either 40 or person 50.
Furthermore, person 20 is with person 24, or person 22 is with person 50.

Solving
-------
1 Generate all possible sets of people for a single team and store
  these sets in an IloIntTupleSet
  A team is represented by an ordered group of people.
  In this example, a possible solution of a team means taking into account
  all the constraints except the additional constraints (AC).

2 Find a compatible configuration for the 10 teams.
  An allowed assignment constraint forces each team to be assigned
  one of the possible solutions generated in step 1.
  Then, we need to take into account the additional constraints, as well
  as the fact that a person can be only in one team.
