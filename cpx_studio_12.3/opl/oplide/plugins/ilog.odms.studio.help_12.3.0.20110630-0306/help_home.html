	<h1>Using the help system</h1>

	<p>
	Browse topics in the <b>Contents</b> frame <span class="icon">(<img
	class="icon" src="resources/contents_view.gif" alt="Contents icon">)</span> on
	the left. Click on a topic to have it displayed. Use the <b>Back</b> and
	<b>Forward</b> buttons to navigate within the history of viewed topics.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Note:</b> If you accessed the documentation directly via the Start menu (and not via the CPLEX Studio IDE), please use the <b>Shutdown CPLEX Studio Help</b> Start menu entry when you have finished using the documentation. This ends the processes associated with the help viewer.</p>

	<h2>Searching</h2>

	<p>
	To quickly locate topics on a particular subject in the documentation, enter a
	query in the <b>Search</b> field.  Use the <b>Search</b> frame <span
	class="icon">(<img class="icon" src="resources/search_results_view.gif" alt="Search icon">)</span>
	to display the Search view.  You can narrow the
	<b>scope</b> of your search by selecting only the sections you are interested in. Click <b>Search scope</b> in the top left of the help viewer and define a scope that includes only the parts of the documentation that you require.
	</p>

	<h2>Synchronizing</h2>

	<p>
	After you run a search and find a topic you were looking for, click either the
	<b>Refresh / Show Current Topic</b> button <span class="icon">(<img class="icon"
	src="resources/e_synch_nav.gif" alt="Refresh / Show Current Topic icon">)</span> or
	<b>Show in Table of Contents</b> button <span class="icon">(<img class="icon"
	src="resources/e_synch_toc_nav.gif" alt="Show in Table of Contents icon">)</span> to match
	the navigation tree with the current topic. You might also find it useful to
	synchronize after following in-topic links.
	</p>

	<h2>Capabilities</h2>

	<p>
	To show documentation about capabilities that are disabled in the application,
	select the <b>Show All Topics</b> button <span class="icon">(<img class="icon"
	src="resources/e_show_all.gif" alt="Refresh / Show Current Topic icon">)
	</span>. When you choose to show all topics in the table of contents, the headings
	for documentation about any disabled activities are shown in the table of contents
	and also appear in search results.
