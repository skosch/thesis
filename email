Dear Professor Chan,

I write to you to in search of a thesis supervisor.

I am entering my fourth year in the EngSci Infrastructure program and focusing mostly on the transportation/logistics side of things. Through other courses, internships etc. I have come to realize that I am most interested in all things modelling, optimization and AI. 

While I don't have a specific thesis topic in mind, I do feel my (admittedly vague) interests align with your research; so I would like to learn more about what you do. Do you have ideas for potential fourth year projects with your lab?

I would be grateful if you were willing to discuss this further, on the phone or in person, within the next two weeks. I have attached a brief CV with a list of relevant coursework as well as a recent ROSI screenshot.

Many thanks and best regards,

Sebastian Kosch
