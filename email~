Dear Professor Chan,

I write to you to in search of a thesis supervisor. I am entering my fourth year in the EngSci Infrastructure program and focusing mostly on the transportation/logistics side of things, but through other courses, internships etc. I have come to realize that I am interested in all things modelling, optimization and AI. I particularly enjoy working with large amounts of data and developing algorithms to analyze it. I feel these (admittedly vague) interests align with your research topics 




Attach CV and Rosi Marks
Include why research is interesting to them
Say that I'm willing to start right away
