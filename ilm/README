                      ILOG License Manager (ILM) 2.6


ILOG License Manager (ILM) is ILOG's license manager for network-based
floating licenses and node-locked licenses.

The installation procedure places ILM in a subdirectory called ilm.
Here you should have the following files:

 - ilmd      the server daemon
 - ihostid   gets the hostid used by ILM
 - ilmcheck  checks license files
 - ilmlist   checks server daemon

These script files automatically select which executable to launch in
the subdirectory(ies) depending on your system.


GETTING YOUR LICENSE KEY

ihostid displays the hostname, the hostid, and a checksum for the
current host.  To get your license key, run ihostid, and send the
information displayed to ILOG.

Example:

% ihostid 
The hostname of this machine is    republique
The ILOG-hostid of this machine is 7140214e
The checksum of this hostid is     43349
