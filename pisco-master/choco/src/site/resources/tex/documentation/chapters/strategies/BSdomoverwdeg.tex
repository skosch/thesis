\begin{notedef}
  \texttt{DomOverWDegBranchingNew} is a \textbf{n-ary branching} assigning distinct values to an integer variable. It maintains (incrementally or dynamically) on each constraint, the count of the failures caused by the constraint from the beginning of the search.
To each variable are then associated, at any time, three values: $dom$ the current domain size, $deg$ the current number of uninstantiated constraints involving the variable, and $w$ the sum of the counters associated with these $deg$ constraints.
The strategy selects the variable with the smallest ratio $r_i=dom/w*deg$.  Ties are randomly broken when \mylst{seed != null}.
The variable is then successively assigned, in each branch, to a next selected value.
% er a counter on each constraint. Whenever a dead-end occurs, the counter associated with the contraint that just failed is updated during search whenever a dead-end occurs. Then, the weight, $w$, of a variable $X_i$ is the sum of the weights of the constraints involving $X_i$ and at least one uninstantiated variable. And combining $w$ with the domain size, $dom$, and the degree, $deg$, of $X_i$, this strategy selects the variable with the smallest ratio $r_i=dom/w*deg$.
$$B_1: x=v_1,\quad B_2: x= v_2,\quad\ldots,\quad B_m: x= v_m,\qquad\text{ with } x=\arg\min\bigl(\frac{dom_x}{w_x*deg_x}\bigr)$$
