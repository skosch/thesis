\begin{notedef}
  \texttt{SetTimes} is a \textbf{n-ary branching} for scheduling problems with makespan minimization objective, fixing distinct task variables to their earliest starting time.
At each node, a set of available tasks is considered then, in each branch, one task variable is selected and its starting time is set to its smallest value. 
The task variables are selected in order according to a \mylst{TaskVarSelector}, or in the decreasing order defined by a \mylst{Comparator}, ties being randomly broken when boolean \mylst{rand} is set. 
%The selected variable is either chosen by a \mylst{TaskVarSelector} or as the maximal element according to a \mylst{Comparator}. Ties in the variable selection are randomly broken when boolean \mylst{rand} is set. 
\emph{The search is not complete: do not use within a} \texttt{solveAll}. 
$$B_1: T_1.start=\underline{T_1.start},\quad B_2: T_2.start=\underline{T_2.start},\quad \ldots,\quad B_n: T_n.start=\underline{T_n.start}$$
