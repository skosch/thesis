\chapter{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
The improved MIP model currently performs best, mostly owed to constraint
\eqref{eq:mipnopp} which excludes a large number of potential batch assignments.

The batch-by-batch decomposition using MIP to assemble batches, while an
improvement over Malapert's MIP model, is not satisfactory; the relaxations are
too lax for the decomposition to compensate for the overhead of a naive
branch-and-bound search.

The goal is to solve instances with up to 50 jobs in less than an hour (a
performance comparable to that of Malapert's global constraint).
