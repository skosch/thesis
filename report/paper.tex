\chapter{Introduction}
This paper discusses three different approaches, and several variations on them,
to solving the problem of scheduling non-identical jobs on a batch processing
machine. Batch processing machines, for the purposes of this paper, can process
multiple, non-identical jobs simultaneously -- but all jobs must be loaded into and
unloaded from the machine at once, which introduces a considerable twist on the ``simple
parallel resources'' known from other cases.

The machines in question represents real-life resources like autoclaves or
ovens, which can process multiple items at a time, but often cannot be opened at
random -- in fact, such machines often need to wait for the largest item in the
batch to be done before the next batch can be inserted.

Malapert proposed a custom constraint programming algorithm consisting of a set of
filtering rules to solve the problem. He achieved considerably better speeds
than with a simple mixed-integer model. In this paper, we present 1) an
improvement to his MIP model, 2) a CP model and 3) a decomposition approach to
``divide and conquer'' the problem.

\section{Problem definition}
We model the problem as follows: assume we are given a set of jobs $J$, each of
which has a processing time (or ``length'') $p_j$ and a size (or ``capacity
requirement'') $s_j$ -- this notation follows Malapert's paper. Each job also
has a due date $d_j$. The machine is characterized by its capacity $b$, and in
every batch, the jobs' summed sizes must not exceed this number. All values are
integer.

The machine can only process one batch $k$ of jobs at a time, and batches always
take as long as the longest job in the batch (i.e. $P_k = \max_{j \in k}(p_j)$).
Our objective is to minimize the lateness $L$ of the latest job in $J$, where
$L$ is the difference between the job's completion time $C_j$ and its due date
$d_j$ -- in formal terms, \textit{min.} $\Lmax = \max_j(C_j - d_j)$. The job's
completion time, however, is the completion time of the batch, which in turn
finishes with its \textit{longest} job as stated above.

Malapert uses the format established by Graham et al. \cite{graham_notation} to
summarize the problem as $1|\textit{p-batch}; b < n;
\textit{non-identical}|\Lmax$, where $\textit{p-batch};b<n$ represents the
parallel-batch nature and the finite capacity of the resource. A simpler version
with identical job sizes was shown to be strongly NP-hard by Brucker et al.
\cite{brucker}, and this problem, then, is no less difficult.

It helps to visualize the jobs before delving into the technicalities of
scheduling them. Figure \ref{fig:intro_tetris} shows a solution to a sample
problem with eight jobs and a resource with capacity $b = 20$.

\section{Organization of this paper}
After reviewing some of the most relevant publications on both general MIP/CP models and
batch scheduling problems, we first describe Malapert's original MIP model in
section \ref{sec:malapertmipmodel}. We then present possible improvements to the
model. Section \ref{sec:cpmodel} introduces a CP formulation of the same
problem. Sections \ref{sec:mipdecomp} and \ref{sec:cpdecomp} describe a
decomposition approach.

An empirical comparison of the methods and a discussion of the results follow in
sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:discussion}.
