\section{Empirical results}
Malapert uses benchmark data by Daste. For design purposes, I created my own set of randomized job lists, with $s_j, p_j \in [1, 20]$ and $d_j \in [1, 10n]$ where $n$ is the number of jobs. Here is the Python code used:

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
import random

random.seed(None)

for i in range(11, 20) + range(10,100,10):
    for j in range(1, 10):
        with open( "data_" + str(i) + "_" + str(j), "wb") as csvfile:
            csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=",")
            csvwriter.writerow(['s_j', 'p_j', 'd_j'])
            for job in range(i):
                csvwriter.writerow([random.randrange(1,20), random.randrange(1,20), random.randrange(1,5*i)])
        csvfile.close()
\end{lstlisting}

CSV files can be read in with \texttt{IloCsvReader} and \texttt{IloCsvLine}.

\subsection{Comparison of CPU time used by various models}
Figure \ref{fig:comp_times} shows the CPU time used by the models. Ten sample
job sets are used per number of jobs, represented as $\left[\{10.0, \dots, 10.9\},
\{11.0, \dots, 11.9\},\dots \right]$ on the horizontal axis. The models were run
on an i7 Q740 CPU, which has $2 \times 4$ cores. Cplex supports multithreading
and as such, elapsed wall clock time is significantly lower in most cases.
