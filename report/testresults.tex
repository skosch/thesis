\section{Empirical comparison of described models}
The models were tested on a set of job lists. Malapert's paper uses benchmark
job lists by Daste et al. \cite{daste1, daste2}. Since neither publication is
available online, I created my own set of randomized job lists for the purposes
of this paper, with $s_j, p_j \in [1, 20]$ and $d_j \in [1, 10n_j]$ where $n_j$ is
the number of jobs. Ten different sample job sets are used per unique value of
$n_j$.

The models were run on an i7 Q740 CPU in single-thread mode, with 8 GB RAM. Solving was aborted
after a time of 300 seconds (5 minutes) \textit{or} when memory was exhausted --
the latter happens with the MIP branch-and-bound model with many of the
benchmark instances of 13 jobs and more.

The CP branch-and-bound model times out on most instances and is not shown here.
