\section{Empirical comparison of described models}\label{sec:results}
The models were tested on a set of job lists. Malapert's paper uses benchmark
job lists by \citet{daste1, daste2}. Since neither publication is
available online, I created my own set of randomized job lists for the purposes
of this paper, with $s_j, p_j \in [1, 20]$ and $d_j \in [1, 10n_j]$ where $n_j$ is
the number of jobs.\footnote{These instances will be updated to reflect the
feature distributions used in Daste et al.} Ten different sample job sets are
used per unique value of $n_j$. The times shown in figure \ref{fig:comp_times}
are averaged over those ten instances for each $n_j$.

The models were run on an i7 Q740 CPU in single-thread mode, with 8 GB RAM.
Solving was aborted after a time of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

The CP branch-and-bound model times out on most instances and is not shown here.
The CP model times out on one 12-job instance and gets progressively worse with
more jobs; similar to Malapert's original MIP model.
