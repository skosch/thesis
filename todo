1. Use cumulative constraint to strengthen inferences about bin-packing in a
temporal way
2. Think about cardinality constraint: number of different pj's vs. number of
different possible batch sizes (e.g., one batch will have to have the size of
the longest job)
3. Think about empty space that will happen
4. Korf bin packing: Generate a bin at every branch, reason about why one bin
packing is better than another
5. Reason about the max TIME a batch can take given a partial assignment, and
then clip that time to select possible batches a batch can go into.
6. The first batch has to contain the earliest job. Once the first batch is
packed, the second batch has to contain the next earliest job.
